### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer.

### Code

Template code is provided in the notebook file. 
### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `...\..\` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook XXX.ipynb
```
or
```bash
ipython notebook XXX.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.

### Data
